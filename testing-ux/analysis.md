### 1. Initial Thoughts

The desktop interface exhibits a **Split-Screen Attention Model**. Unlike the vertical flow of mobile, user focus oscillates between the Value Proposition (Left) and the Technical Proof (Right). The high-contrast palette effectively anchors attention on conversion elements.

### 2. Heat Zone Analysis

#### **Primary Focus (High Intensity)**

* **Element:** Headline (`LAUNCH BNB [rotate copy]]`) & Primary CTA (`Launch Your Token`).
* **Observation:** The combination of large typography and the "pop-out" orange button creates the strongest visual anchor.
* **User Intent:** "What is this?"  "How do I start?"

#### **Secondary Anchor (Medium-High Intensity)**

* **Element:** Live Bonding Curve Chart (Right Panel).
* **Observation:** The visual complexity of the graph and dynamic price data (`0.0000234 BNB`) draws the eye immediately after the headline.
* **User Intent:** Validation. The user verifies platform activity/legitimacy ("Is this real?") before committing.

#### **Navigation Scan (Medium Intensity)**

* **Element:** Top Right Actions (`Connect Wallet` / `Launch Token`).
* **Observation:** Standard "F-Pattern" scanning applies here. Experienced Web3 users habitually look to this corner for wallet connection.

### 3. Key Findings

* **The "Ping-Pong" Effect:** Eye tracking suggests a rapid scan path: **Headline (Left)  Chart (Right)  Button (Left)**. The chart effectively serves as "social proof" to support the primary CTA.
* **Color Psychology:** The consistent use of Orange (`#Colors`) successfully links the *Value* ("BNB") to the *Action* (Buttons), reducing cognitive load.
* **Risk Assessment:** The chart is highly engaging. There is a minor risk it may distract from the CTA if the data displayed becomes too complex or confusing.

### 4. Recommendations

1. **Maintain CTA Dominance:** Ensure the "Launch Your Token" button always maintains the highest contrast ratio relative to the chart elements.
2. **Verify Chart Data:** Since the chart is a hot zone, ensure the "Demo" data looks realistic; "fake" looking curves can degrade trust immediately.
3. **Redundancy Check:** Monitor clicks on the Top Right "Launch Token" vs. Center "Launch Your Token". If the Top Right usage is low, consider swapping it for "Connect Wallet" exclusively.
